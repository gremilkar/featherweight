ABOUT
===============

Featherweight is an addons site for Mozilla based software products. Contrary to the Zamboni platform, Featherweight is written in PHP, based on the CodeIgniter framework, and aims to be a more lightweight, simplistic alternative.

Since many opensource projects use free or shared hosting, sometimes php is the best way to go. In terms of performance, not having a persistent process is sometimes required, such as with Dreamhost.
