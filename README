ABOUT
===============

Featherweight is an addons site for Mozilla based software products. 
Contrary to the Zamboni platform, it is written in PHP. Featherweight 
is based on the CodeIgniter framework, and aims to be a more 
lightweight, simplistic alternative.

Since many opensource projects use free or shared hosting, sometimes 
php is the best way to go. In terms of performance, not having a 
persistent process is sometimes required, such as with Dreamhost.

INSTALL
===============

All that's required is a standard LAMP setup - Linux, Apache, MySQL, 
and PHP...

From there, decide where in your webroot or subdomain, or vhost you'd 
like to put Featherweight, and clone the git repo there. Then, edit 
application/config/database.php to set your database details. YOU MUST
set the absolute path to featherweight/cache/db and turn caching on in
order to cache database queries (HIGHLY RECCOMENDED!).

Further information for configuration is detailed in each of the files 
in application/config/*.php

Then, navigate your browser to the location you installed featherweight,
and it will guide you through the setup process.
